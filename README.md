Algorithms-Assignment02
=======================

This project is to write a program that implements the union-find algorithm and  use it to estimate the value of “percolation threshold” for a square lattice

percolation.exe p n s // p - percolation probability; n - # of runs; s – board size; 
 // your program should output percolation rate 
percolation.exe fname.txt // the game board setting is saved in the file named fname.txt 
//1 stands for open site; 0 for closed site. 
 // your program should output the number of clusters on the board
